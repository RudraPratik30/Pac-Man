<p style="font-size: large;">Hey All!
I created this Pac-Man game as my assignment for the course CAT 206 (Artificial Intelligence Principles and Techniques).
<br>
You Can play this game:<br>
* To run the game, download both the files (index.html & index.js) and
store them in the same folder.<br>
* Open the index.html file in a browser and you can start playing!
